# Arduino-Bluetooth-Car

## Arduino Car controlled by Labview
In this project We are going to learn how to build an Arduino Car Controlled by Labview from USB or Bluetooth. The components and materials are commom for makers and you will not have problem to find them.

## MAIN FEAUTURES
- Arduino Compatible ( You can used Model Uno, Mega, Due, Nano or others)
- Drivers in a board shield with borners ready to connect and work.
- HMI control with Labview.
- Power supply from 6 - 12 Volts
- Powerful control screen fast connection by USB
- Shield board with H brigde L293D
- Common components, very easy to find in our local electronic store.

## CAR  KIT REVIEW
The following tutorial is for this model of car that you can see below, with 2 DC motors, this model is small and practical, kind remind you that 2 DC motors need a separate power source, also you should consider that in your projects; for example if we use the car with 4 motors, our power supply will have to be of a hight capacity.
